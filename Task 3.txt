   - Disable unnecessary network services
   - Implement service-specific security configurations
   - Regular service inventory and review

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Isolate critical systems
   - Implement firewall rules
   - Monitor network traffic

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Deploy intrusion detection systems
   - Enable comprehensive logging
   - Regular vulnerability scanning schedule

### Long-Term Security Strategy

## Problems I Faced

### Technical Challenges
1. **Scanner Configuration:** Initial setup of Nessus required proper licensing and configuration
2. **Network Connectivity:** Ensuring scanner could properly reach target system
3. **Firewall Interference:** Some scans blocked by local firewall, requiring rule adjustments
4. **Scan Duration:** Comprehensive scan took considerable time to complete all checks

### Analysis Difficulties
1. **Result Interpretation:** Understanding CVSS scores and their practical implications
2. **False Positive Identification:** Distinguishing real vulnerabilities from scanner artifacts
3. **Prioritization Challenges:** Determining which issues require immediate attention
4. **Remediation Planning:** Mapping findings to specific corrective actions

## Conclusion

This vulnerability scanning assignment provided valuable hands-on experience with professional security assessment tools. The scan of my local system revealed 18 total findings, with 1 high-severity issue requiring immediate attention and 5 medium-severity issues needing remediation planning.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **SMB signing enforcement** is critical for Windows network security
- **SSL/TLS configuration** requires ongoing attention and updates
- **Regular vulnerability scanning** is essential for maintaining security posture
- **Risk-based prioritization** helps focus remediation efforts effectively

**Overall Security Assessment:** The system shows a reasonably good security baseline with no critical vulnerabilities, but the SMB signing issue represents a significant network security risk that requires immediate remediation.

This exercise demonstrated the importance of automated vulnerability scanning in identifying security gaps that might otherwise go unnoticed, and highlighted the need for systematic security assessment as part of ongoing cybersecurity management.
